              <h3>Do I need to attend the weekly meetings to sign up for trips?</h3>
              <p>If you need to borrow gear for a trip, you will receive and return it at the weekly meetings. Otherwise, you can reach out to an officer to be signed up for a trip. Members are encouraged to attend meetings as those who do will be favored for adventures with limited availability, and the weekly meetings are a great way to familiarize yourself with the people you're going to go outside with.</p>

              <h3>Where does UTCH go?</h3>
              <p>We do trips all over Tennessee and the United States. There are many local backpacking/hiking trips (Carvers Gap, Smokey Mountains, Grayson Highlands, Big South Fork), canoeing/rafting trips (Ocoee, Toccoa, Clear Creek, Tugaloo), along with two larger trips over spring and winter break (Cumberland Island, Big Bend, Gila, Superstitions).</p>
